# Simple Linear Regression for Placement Prediction

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model to predict placements based on a given dataset. The goal is to analyze the relationship between independent and dependent variables to predict outcomes using a linear model. This project is implemented using Python libraries like `numpy`, `pandas`, and `scikit-learn`.

## Project Overview

The steps involved in this project are as follows:

1. **Data Loading and Inspection**
   - The dataset (`placement (2).csv`) is loaded using `pandas`.
   - A quick inspection of the first few rows is performed to understand its structure.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - The independent (X) and dependent (y) variables are extracted from the dataset.
   - The data is then split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`.

3. **Model Definition**
   - A custom linear regression class `MeraLR` is defined, which includes:
     - A method for fitting the model (`fit`).
     - A method for predicting values (`predict`).
     - A method to calculate the coefficients (slope and intercept).

4. **Model Training**
   - The model is trained on the training set (`X_train`, `y_train`).

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Predictions are made on the test set.
   - The performance of the model is evaluated using appropriate metrics.

6. **Visualization**
   - The results are visualized using `matplotlib` to show the best-fit line along with the scatter plot of data points.

## Prerequisites

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `sklearn`
- `matplotlib`


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project (`placement (2).csv`) contains the following columns:

- **X**: Independent variable (e.g., years of experience, scores, etc.)
- **y**: Dependent variable (e.g., salary, placement outcome, etc.)

## Results and Analysis

The final model is able to capture the relationship between the independent and dependent variables, and the predictions are visualized using scatter plots and regression lines. The performance can be further tuned by experimenting with additional features and using more advanced models.

## Future Scope

- Include more features for a multivariate linear regression model.
- Experiment with different regression algorithms (e.g., Ridge, Lasso).
- Perform feature engineering and analysis for better insights.
